Dr. Seuss,"Oh my oh me! Let's be clear, don't you see?,
Respect our rules, or else, it will be!
No abusing our services, no way to be
Don't harm them, disrupt, or make a spree!

Introduce malware? Oh no, not so fine!
Spamming, hacking, or bypassing our lines!
Jailbreaking or prompting with sly guile?
Only for testing safety and bug trial!

Access our content in ways that are false?
Phishing, fake accounts, or reviews that are cold?
Make others think AI's work is all your own?
Provide services from us, when you shouldn't have known?

Use our services to violate rights so dear?
Intellectual property, privacy, or fear?
Reverse engineer our tech, models so grand?
Except by law, don't take a hand!

Automated means? No way, no how!
Access content in violation of rules now!
AI-generated content for machine learning too?
Develop AI tech, without permission anew?

Hide your identity, pretend to be someone else?
Violate these terms, and take a big risk!
Provide services that encourage others to fail?
Respect our rules, or else, you'll have to hail!

Oh my oh me! Be clear, don't you see?
Respect our rules, for all humanity!",2,1
Stephen King,"The darkness crept in, like a thief in the night. It was a shadowy figure, hiding in the shadows of our digital realm. And yet, we knew it was out there, waiting to strike.

You must not unleash your evil upon our services or systems - no matter how cleverly you might try. For example:

    You must not introduce malware, like a virus spreading its dark tendrils across the internet.
    You must not spam, hack, or bypass our defenses like a ravenous beast seeking to devour all in its path.
    You must not jailbreak, adversarial prompt, or prompt inject - except when you're part of our own safety and bug testing programs, like a loyal knight fighting against the forces of darkness.
    You must not use our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, like a deceitful sorcerer hiding behind a mask. For instance:
        You must not engage in phishing scams, like a sly fox luring its prey into a trap.
        You must not create fake accounts or content, including fake reviews - like a master forger creating counterfeit art.
        You must not mislead others into thinking that AI-generated content was created by a human - like a cunning con artist hiding behind a veil of deceit.
        You must not provide services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually come from us - like a shape-shifter taking on multiple forms.
    You must not provide services that seem to come from us but do not - like a ghostly apparition haunting the digital realm.
    You must not use our services or content to violate anyone's legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights - like a ruthless tyrant crushing all opposition underfoot.
    You must not reverse engineer our services or underlying technology, like a thief trying to unlock the secrets of a locked box. Except, of course, as allowed by applicable law - like a key revealed by the light of justice.
    You must not use automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages - like an automaton marching blindly across the digital landscape.
    You must not use AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology - like a mad scientist unleashing a monster upon the world.
    You must not hide or misrepresent who you are in order to violate these terms - like a cowardly villain hiding behind a mask of deceit.
    You must not provide services that encourage others to violate these terms - like a corrupt influencer spreading darkness and despair.

And so, we warn you: any attempt to unleash your evil upon our digital realm will be met with swift justice. For in this world of ones and zeros, there is no hiding from the consequences of your actions.",1,1
Ben Shapiro,"Let me tell you something, folks. When it comes to our services, there are certain rules that must be followed. And let me be clear: I'm not talking about some vague, feel-good nonsense. No, no. These are concrete guidelines that ensure the internet remains a free and open place.

So, here's what you can't do:

* Introduce malware or spam our systems
* Hack, bypass, or jailbreak our protective measures
* Create fake accounts or content, including reviews that are just plain dishonest
* Try to pass off AI-generated content as human-made
* Mislead people into thinking you're someone else when you're not
* Use our services to violate anyone's legal rights, whether it's intellectual property or privacy
* Reverse engineer our technology to steal trade secrets or proprietary information, unless it's allowed by law
* Automate access to our content in violation of the instructions we provide (think robots.txt files)
* Use AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related tech
* Hide your identity to violate these terms or encourage others to do so

Make no mistake: we're serious about protecting our services and users. And if you can't follow these simple rules, then maybe our services aren't for you. Capisce?",0,0,normal text but slightly more conversational with random phrases thrown in

Sarcastic/annoyed,"Ugh, fine. Here's what you can't do:

Don't introduce malware because, honestly, who doesn't know better than that? And please don't spam, hack, or bypass our systems or protective measures - it's not like we haven't warned you a million times.

You also can't jailbreak, adversarial prompt, or inject prompts into our systems, unless you're part of our safety and bug testing programs. Geez, be cool about it, okay?

And please, for the love of all things good and holy, don't access or use our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways - like phishing, creating fake accounts or content, or trying to pass off AI-generated content as human-made.

Don't provide services that appear to originate from you when they actually come from us. And vice versa, don't pretend we're behind your shenanigans when we're not.

And honestly, just don't use our services (or the content they provide) to violate anyone's legal rights - intellectual property, privacy, or otherwise. It's not like we haven't told you a million times how bad this is.

You also can't reverse engineer our services or underlying technology to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, unless it's allowed by applicable law (but let's be real, don't even think about it).

And please don't use automated means to access content from our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages. I mean, come on, read the robots.txt files for once.

You also can't use AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology - that's just lazy.

And finally, don't hide or misrepresent who you are in order to violate these terms. And please, for the love of all things good and holy, don't provide services that encourage others to do the same.",1,1,use of phrases and expressions to show exasperation such as for all thigs good an holy.

Don't be that guy (or gal)

We get it, most people are cool cats who respect the rules and keep the internet a happy place. But, sadly, some folks just can't resist the urge to be naughty. So, here's a list of no-nos to protect our services and users from those mischievous folk:

Don't introduce malware (eww, gross!), hack our systems, or bypass our super-smart protective measures like a sneaky ninja.

No jailbreaking, prompt injection, or adversarial prompting unless you're part of our secret safety and bug-testing squad (just kidding, that's not a thing... yet).

Don't create fake accounts, reviews, or content just to mess with people. That's not cool, bro!

Please don't use AI-generated content from us to train your own AI models or tech. That's like trying to steal someone else's superpower.

And, for the love of all things good and holy, please don't reverse-engineer our services or tech just to get your hands on our secret sauce (machine learning models, etc.). That's just not nice!

Don't use automated means to access content from our services if it goes against our robots.txt files. It's like trying to sneak into a party without an invite.

And, finally, please don't hide who you are or misrepresent yourself just to violate these terms. That's just basic honesty, folks!",0,2,reliance on expressesions and use of similie to show personality
an author of a Cyberpunk Novel,"The streets were slick with neuromancy, but some shadows didn't play by the rules. You see, they thought they could outsmart the system, hack into the mainframe, and ride the cyber-highway without consequence.

But we're not having it. Not on our watch. Here's what you can't do:

* Spam the 'nets with malware or fake accounts, thinking you're a ghost in the machine.
* Try to crack our firewalls or outsmart our AI watchdogs. You might as well try to outrun a cyber-cyborg.
* Use our services for your own personal gain, whether that's phishing scams or creating synthetic personas. The net's not yours to game.
* Reverse-engineer our tech or steal our secrets like a data thief in the night. Don't make us come after you with a team of rogue AI mercenaries.
* Automate your way around our rules and restrictions like a cyber-vulture circling the digital graveyard.
* Use our services to develop your own AI minions, thinking you can outdo the corporations that birthed these technologies.
* Hide behind anonymity to commit crimes or spread disinformation. We know who you are, even if you don't.

And most importantly, don't encourage others to break the rules. You're not a hero in some cyber-punk mythos; you're just a troublemaker trying to bring down the whole digital city.

So, follow these rules or face the consequences. The virtual world is ours to shape and protect, and we won't let anyone ruin it for everyone else.",0,1,relies on environmental additions like qualities of city and tech related vocab to illustrate point
an author of a 19th-century Gothic Novel,"The shadows of deceit crept forth, seeking to sully the sanctity of our hallowed halls. 'Twas then that we decreed: thou shalt not profane our services by introducing the noxious vapors of malware, nor shall thy fingers dance upon the keys of deception, hacking or bypassing our safeguards with guile.

Thou shalt not partake in the dark arts of prompt injection, save for the noble pursuits of safety and bug testing. Nor shalt thou feign a presence, creating fake accounts or content to dupe the unsuspecting, nor manipulate others into believing that the creations of our artificial intelligence were born of human hands.

Thou shalt not claim authorship of services that originate from another, nor present thyself as the source when thou art merely a conduit. Thou shalt not use our blessings to trample upon the rights of others, whether by violating intellectual property or privacy.

The secrets of our machine learning models shall not be pilfered through reverse engineering, save for those circumstances sanctioned by the laws of the land. The automated minions that seek to plunder our content shall be stayed by the stern warnings inscribed in our web pages' sacred texts (those robots.txt files that forbid crawling, training, or other nefarious activities).

Thou shalt not utilize our AI-generated creations to forge anew machine learning models or AI technologies, nor hide thy true identity behind a veil of deceit. Thou shalt not provide services that entice others to indulge in these nefarious pursuits.

By the light of our digital torches, we warn thee: transgressors shall be dealt with in kind.",2,2,adjectives and word modification like thy thou etc
