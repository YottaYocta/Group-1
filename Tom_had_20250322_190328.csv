"Rewrite the story such that it includes each of the following elements of a good story:
        1. Set the scene (establish who each character in the story is through his actions; show, don't tell)
        2. Inciting incident (generate an event or occurrence that sparks the change in the story; you have freedom to change details about the plot)
        3. Rising Action (build conflict and emotional tension with several smaller incidents, each bringing the reader closer to the decision that needs to be made in the climax)
        4. Climax (choose one)
            - epiphany
            - moral choice
            - decisive action
            - emotional release 
            for each climax category, add emphasis to clearly show that the shift is greater than all previous inciting incidents
            this can be done by introducing a conflict greater than all previous conflicts, adding emotional tension and physical tension through embodied, physical actions like movement, or by altering the writing style subtly to show a change in intensity.
        5. denouement (after the most important change, epiphany, moral choice, decisive action, or emotional release as been taken, slowly wind down the plot, gradually lowering the intensities of any additional incidents or occurrences in the story)

        take care to not actually label sections with 'set the scene, inciting incident', instead use writing style and language to convey each part of the story
   ","Tom's fist clenched as he watched his guest, a tall, lanky man with a mop of curly hair, saunter into his living room. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and yesterday's pizza. Tom's eyes narrowed as he took in the sight of the stranger lounging on his favorite armchair. Something about the guy's smug expression grated on Tom's nerves.

As the guest began to monologue, his words dripped with condescension, Tom's anger simmered just below the surface. His grip on the couch cushion tightened as he listened to the stranger's opinions on everything from politics to sports teams. The room seemed to shrink, and Tom's breathing quickened. He felt like a coiled spring ready to snap.

The guest's words dripped like acid, burning away any shred of civility in their conversation. Tom's face flushed with rage as he stood up, his chair scraping against the floor. The stranger didn't seem to notice, too caught up in his own self-importance.

Tom's anger boiled over, and he punched a hole in the wall, the sound echoing through the room like a challenge. The guest's eyes widened, and he backed away slowly, his hands raised in a defensive gesture. Tom watched, seething, as the stranger beat a hasty retreat.

The silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with regret. Tom sank onto the couch, his eyes fixed on the hole he had punched into the wall. He felt like he'd lost control, like a part of him had been torn away. The room seemed to spin, and Tom's vision blurred as he struggled to come to terms with what he'd done.

Days passed, and Tom found himself avoiding mirrors, afraid of what he might see staring back at him. His house became a prison, the walls closing in on him like a trap. He started taking long walks, trying to clear his head, but even the fresh air couldn't wash away the shame.

One evening, as he was walking through the park, Tom stumbled upon a group of children playing soccer. Their laughter and shouts of excitement were infectious, and for a moment, Tom forgot about his anger and regret. He watched, mesmerized, as the kids played without fear or judgment.

As he turned to leave, one of the children caught his eye â€“ a little boy with a mop of curly hair, just like the stranger who had triggered Tom's outburst. The boy's smile was genuine, untainted by malice or condescension. In that moment, something inside Tom shifted.

He realized that his anger wasn't about the guest; it was about himself. It was about the fear of being seen as weak, of being hurt again. He saw that his reaction had been a desperate attempt to control the situation, to keep others at arm's length.

Tom returned home, feeling lighter, freer. The hole in the wall became a symbol of his growth, a reminder that he could change, that he didn't have to let his temper define him. As he sat on his couch, surrounded by the quiet of his house, Tom felt a sense of peace settle over him like a warm blanket. He knew that he still had work to do, but for the first time in a long time, he felt hopeful."
