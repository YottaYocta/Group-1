Dr. Seuss,"In the land of CELSIUS, where energy flows free,
We caution with care, for you to see:
No more than two cans, or servings so fine,
Per day is our limit, a daily divine.

The FDA's wise words, we heed with glee,
Drinking up to 400 mg, just right for you and me.
But remember, dear friend, caffeine's effects vary wide,
Depending on how your body metabolizes inside.

If new to energy drinks, take it slow and easy as can be,
Just one CELSIUS product per day, a perfect harmony.
And if you're a pro, with a high caffeine flair,
One every 24 hours, or two at the most, beware!

So heed our advice, and drink with gentle might,
In moderation's key, to avoid the dark of night."
Stephen King,"The darkness crept in with each can, like a whispered secret in the dead of night. Two twelve-ouncers, no more, lest ye succumb to the demon's grasp. And heed this warning, mortal: follow the serving guidelines for all other CELSIUS concoctions, lest they consume thy very soul.

The FDA, that bastion of truth and reason, decreed that two such cans, a veritable mountain of caffeine, would be safe for most... but we know better. Caffeine's power is not to be trifled with; it seeps into thy very being like a cold, dark mist. Metabolism varies, a cruel joke played upon humanity by the capricious gods.

So heed this warning, traveler: if thou art new to these elixirs of the damned, limit thyself to one can in a day's span. And shouldst thou be blessed with an iron will, tolerate but two such potions within a 24-hour cycle... or risk inviting the darkness in, like a moth drawn to the flame.

Beware, mortal, for once thou hast crossed this threshold, there is no turning back..."
Ben Shapiro,"Here's my attempt at rewriting the text in a style reminiscent of Ben Shapiro:

""So let me get this straight: the FDA says that consuming up to 400mg of caffeine - roughly equivalent to two 12oz cans of CELSIUS Energy Drink - is safe for most people. And I'm supposed to believe that? Please. That's just a recipe for disaster, folks. Caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person, which means that some poor soul out there might end up with a nervous breakdown after downing two of these things.

Now, if you're a newbie to the energy drink scene, I'm telling you: start slow. One CELSIUS product in 24 hours is more than enough for anyone who doesn't want to risk turning into a jittery mess. And don't even get me started on those with high caffeine tolerances - two CELSIUS beverages or one Celsius Essentials beverage per day? You're asking for trouble, folks. I mean, what's the point of drinking an energy drink if you're just going to crash and burn later?

Let's be real: too much caffeine is a recipe for disaster. It's like playing Russian roulette with your brain chemistry. So yeah, sure, go ahead and indulge in these things if you want - but don't say I didn't warn you."""
a Chinese Speaker (output Simplified Chinese Character output),"我们建议每天不超过两瓶12盎斯的CELSIUS能量饮料，或者按照所有其他CELSIUS产品的日常服务推荐。


FDA 建议饮用到 400mg 的咖啡因 - 等同于两瓶12盎斯的 CELSIUS 能源饮料 — 对大多数个人来说是安全的。但是，每个人都有不同对咖啡因的代谢方式，这意味着咖啡因敏感度从人到人有所不同（FDA，2018）.


如果您是新手能源饮料，我们建议每天不超过一瓶 CELSIUS 产品。如果您对咖啡因有高耐受性，我们建议每天不超过两瓶 CELSIUS 饮料，或者每天一 bottle Celsius Essentials 饪。"
a Hawaiian Pidgin Speaker (use Hawaiian Pidgin output),"Braddahs an' Sistahs! We recommend no more dan two 12 oz cans, or two servings, per day, an' dat you follow da daily serving recommendations fo' all odda CELSIUS products, yeah?

Da FDA advise dat drinkin' up to 400 mg of caffeine - da equivalent to two 12oz cans a CELSIUS Energy Drink - is safe fo' most individuals. But everybody metabolize caffeine differently, means caffeine sensitivity vary from person to person, yeah? (FDA, 2018)

If you new to energy drinks, we recommend drinkin' no more dan one CELSIUS product in a 24-hour period, da kine tings! If you got high tolerance to caffeine, we recommend no more dan two CELSIUS beverages, or one Celsius Essentials beverage every 24 hours, yeah?"
a Russian Speaker (use Russian Output),"Мы рекомендуем не более двух банок по 12 унций или две порции в день, и следовать рекомендациям по дневным порциям для всех других продуктов CELSIUS.

FDA советует, что потребление до 400 мг кофеина - эквивалентное двум банкам по 12 унций энергетического напитка CELSIUS - безопасно для большинства людей. Однако everyone метаболизирует кофein differently, что означает, что чувствительность кофеина варьируется от человека к человеку (FDA, 2018).

Если вы новичок в энергетических напитках, мы рекомендуем пить не более одного продукта CELSIUS в 24-часовой период. Если у вас высокая толерантность к кофеину, мы рекомендуем не более двух продуктов CELSIUS или одной порции Essentials CELSIUS каждые 24 часа."
Sarcastic/annoyed,"Joy, let's talk about the recommended daily intake of our amazing energy drink, CELSIUS!

So, apparently, we recommend no more than TWO (yes, only two) 12 oz cans per day. And if you're lucky enough to have other CELSIUS products lying around, follow those serving recommendations too. Wow, what a thrill-ride.

The FDA is all like ""Hey, up to 400 mg of caffeine is cool for most people."" But let's be real, everyone metabolizes caffeine differently (read: some people are just going to crash and burn sooner). So, enjoy your two cans while you can, because who knows when you'll turn into a jittery mess.

New to energy drinks? Great! Drink no more than one CELSIUS product in 24 hours. You know, for your own good. And if you're one of those lucky folks with a high caffeine tolerance (aka the crazy ones), just stick to two beverages or one Celsius Essentials drink every day. Because, why not, right?

There you have it!"
Funny/Humorous,"So, you want to know the magic number of CELSIUS Energy Drinks you can chug without turning into a caffeine-fueled robot? Well, here's the deal: we recommend capping it at TWO 12oz cans (or two servings) per day. Yeah, that's right - don't go crazy on us! And remember to follow those daily serving recommendations for our other products, or you might just turn into a human coffee mug.

But wait, what does the FDA say? Well, they're all like, ""Hey, humans can handle up to 400mg of caffeine - that's about two of our Energy Drinks."" But let's be real, everyone metabolizes caffeine differently. Like, some people can drink an entire pot of coffee and still fall asleep. And others... well, they turn into zombies.

So, if you're new to the energy drink scene, we say: start with one, max out at two in a 24-hour period. If you're a caffeine rockstar, you can have up to two CELSIUS beverages (or one Celsius Essentials - don't get us started on that stuff). Just remember, too much of a good thing is still... too much."
an author of a Cyberpunk Novel,"In the shadows of Neo-Eden's neon-drenched sprawl, whispers circulated about the limits of CELSIUS Energy Drink. Those in the know recommended no more than two 12 oz cans, or two doses of synthetic vitality, per day. For those with a taste for excess, heed the warning: overindulgence could lead to system crashes and burnouts.

The FDA's cryptic message echoed through the darknet: ""Up to 400 mg of caffeine is safe for most."" But insiders knew better – everyone's bio-rhythms were unique, like fingerprints on a black market chip. Caffeine sensitivity varied as much as the net's hidden corners, where predators lurked and data flowed.

Newbies to the energy drink underground should be cautious: no more than one CELSIUS product in a 24-hour cycle, lest they crash and burn. Those with a high tolerance for the digital stimulant might push their limits, but even they were advised to ration their fix – no more than two CELSIUS beverages or one Celsius Essentials dose every 24 hours."
an author of a 19th-century Gothic Novel,"As the moon casts its silvery glow upon the midnight hour, I caution thee, dear friend, to partake of no more than two vessels, each containing twelve ounces of the mysterious elixir known as CELSIUS. Heed this warning, lest thou fall prey to the intoxicating allure of these potent draughts.

The authorities, those stern and unforgiving guardians of public health, have decreed that a daily allowance of four hundred milligrams of caffeine - an amount equivalent to two of these enchanted vessels - is tolerable for most individuals. Yet, as the shadows dance upon the walls, I must confess that the human body doth metabolize this stimulating substance in ways both mysterious and variable.

Thus, I implore thee, if thou art a novice in the dark arts of energy drinks, to restrict thy consumption to but one CELSIUS beverage within a span of twenty-four hours. And should thy constitution be fortified by an abundance of caffeine, thou mayest indulge in two such draughts - or, if thou preferst, one solitary serving of the esteemed Celsius Essentials - over the course of this same nocturnal period.

Beware, dear friend, for the temptation to overindulge is strong, and the consequences of thy actions shall be yours to bear alone."
