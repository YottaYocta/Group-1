Dr. Seuss,"In the land of CELSIUS, where energy flows free,
We caution you dear friends, to heed our decree:
No more than two cans, or servings so fine,
Per day, my dear friends, for your own good in line.

The FDA says, with a voice so wise and kind,
That 400 mg of caffeine is safe to find.
But remember, dear ones, that we all metabolize
Caffeine at different rates, like a crazy tease!

For those new to energy drinks, don't you fret,
Just have one CELSIUS, and take a little rest.
And if you're a veteran, with a high caffeine toll,
Limit yourself to two, or maybe just one goal.

In 24 hours, that is, my friends so dear,
To keep your energy up, without a single fear.
So heed this advice, from yours truly, Dr. Seuss,
And CELSIUS will be your friend, in all your energy's cruise!"
Stephen King,"The dark secrets of CELSIUS Energy Drink. They whisper to me of caution, of restraint, as I scribble these words by the flickering light of a candle.

We recommend no more than two 12 oz cans, or two servings, per day - a paltry ration against the hellish brew that lurks within. Heed this warning, mortal, lest you succumb to its sweet, bitter taste.

The FDA, those guardians of our sanity, deem it safe for most individuals to consume up to 400 mg of caffeine - the equivalent of two 12oz cans of CELSIUS Energy Drink, a toxic elixir that courses through your veins like lifeblood. Yet, they caution, everyone metabolizes this dark magic differently, and so the curse of caffeine sensitivity hangs over us all, a constant reminder of our own mortality.

If you are new to these accursed energy drinks, beware - we recommend no more than one CELSIUS product in a 24-hour period, lest the devil's brew consume your very soul. And if you possess a high tolerance to this infernal stuff, we warn you: no more than two CELSIUS beverages, or one Celsius Essentials beverage every 24 hours. Heed our words, mortal, and spare yourself the horrors that lurk within the shadows of your own mind..."
Ben Shapiro,"Here's my attempt at rewriting the text in the style of Ben Shapiro:

""Let me be crystal clear: when it comes to CELSIUS Energy Drink, there are some hard limits you need to stick to. Specifically, I'm talking about a daily maximum of two 12 oz cans or two servings - don't even think about exceeding that. And let's not forget the general guidelines for all other CELSIUS products: follow those serving recommendations to the letter.

Now, the FDA has weighed in on this topic, and it's worth noting their stance. According to them, up to 400mg of caffeine is A-OK for most people - that's equivalent to two 12 oz cans of CELSIUS Energy Drink. But let's not kid ourselves: everyone metabolizes caffeine differently, which means some folks are more sensitive than others (FDA, 2018).

Newbies to the energy drink game? Listen up: I recommend starting with a single serving per day and gradually increasing as needed. And if you're one of those caffeine fiends who can handle it all, just know that even you have a ceiling - two CELSIUS beverages or one Celsius Essentials beverage every 24 hours is the maximum.

So there you have it: CELSIUS Energy Drink guidelines for the win."""
a Chinese Speaker (output Simplified Chinese Character output),"Here is the rewritten text in Simplified Chinese characters:


我们建议每天不超过两瓶12 oz CELSIUS能量饮料，或者两个服务。对所有CELTIUS产品都请遵循日常服用推荐。

FDA 建议 caffeine 的摄入上限为 400mg—相当于两瓶12oz CELSIUS能量饮料——对于大多数人而言，这是安全的。但是，每个人 metabolizes caffein differently，这意味着 caffeine 敏感度会因人而异（FDA，2018）。

如果您新到 energy drinks，我们建议每天不超过一瓶CELTIUS产品。如果您对 caffeine 有高敏感度，我们建议每天不超过两瓶CELTIUS饮料，或者每天一个Celsius Essentials饮料。"
a Hawaiian Pidgin Speaker (use Hawaiian Pidgin output),"Ohana, we recommend no more dan two 12 oz cans, or two servings, per day, an' follow da daily serving recommendations fo' all odah CELSIUS products. Yeah, da FDA say dat drinkin' up to 400 mg of caffeine - dat's like two 12oz cans of CELSIUS Energy Drink, brah - is safe fo' most peopple. But everybody metabolize caffeine differently, meanin' caffeine sensitivity vary from person to person (FDA, 2018).

If you new to energy drinks, we recommend drinkin' no more dan one CELSIUS product in a 24-hour period, okay? If you got high tolerance to caffeine, we recommend no more dan two CELSIUS beverages, or one Celsius Essentials beverage every 24 hours."
a Russian Speaker (use Russian Output),"Мы рекомендуем не более двух 12 oz банок или двух порций в день, и что вы следуете рекомендациям daily serving для всех других продуктов CELSIUS.

ФДА посоветует, что пить до 400 мг кофеина - эквивалентное двум 12-унцем банкам энергетического напитка CELSIUS - безопасно для большинства индивидуумов. Однако, каждый метаболизирует кофеин по-разному, что significa, что чувствительность к кофеину варьирует от человека к человеку (FDA, 2018).

Если вы новый к энергетическим напиткам, мы рекомендуем пить не более одного продукта CELSIUS в течение 24-часового периода. Если у вас высокий уровень толерантности к кофеину, мы рекомендуем не более двух напитков CELSIUS или одного напитка Celsius Essentials каждые 24 часа."
Sarcastic/annoyed,"Oh joy, let me just thrill you with these super exciting guidelines:

We recommend that you don't overdo it on our glorious CELSIUS Energy Drink, okay? Like, seriously, no more than two 12 oz cans (or servings, because who's counting?) per day. And don't even get us started on the other products - just follow the serving size recommendations and be done with it.

The FDA (yay, boring government agency!) says that up to 400 mg of caffeine is safe for most people... or in other words, you can safely drink two cans of our amazing energy drink without turning into a jittery mess. But honestly, who needs that much caffeine? Not me, that's for sure. And apparently, not everyone metabolizes it the same way either (yawn), which means some people might get all squirrely after drinking our delightful beverage (oh no!).

So here's what we suggest:

* If you're new to energy drinks (welcome to the party!), start with one can in a 24-hour period and see how your body reacts. I'm sure it'll be a wild ride.
* And if you have a high tolerance for caffeine (lucky you!): just stick to two CELSIUS beverages or one Essentials beverage every 24 hours. Because, let's be real, too much of a good thing is still too much.

There, happy now?"
Funny/Humorous,"So you wanna mainline some CELSIUS Energy Drink, huh? Well, we won't judge (much). Just remember, two 12oz cans is your daily limit - don't go crazy! And yeah, the FDA says that's a pretty safe amount of caffeine. But let's be real, everyone metabolizes it differently... like how some people can eat an entire pizza by themselves while others get the shakes just thinking about a slice.

New to energy drinks? Start with one, and you won't turn into the human equivalent of a espresso machine. And if you're a caffeine rockstar, cool - but still limit yourself to two CELSIUS beverages (or one Essentials) in 24 hours. Don't say we didn't warn you..."
an author of a Cyberpunk Novel,"In the neon-drenched sprawl of New Eden, where synthetic serums flowed like water, and cybernetic enhancements redefined humanity, the edgy underground whispered secrets about the ultimate high-tech elixir: CELSIUS.

Don't get too hooked on this stuff, man. We recommend a maximum of two 12 oz cans – or two hits, if you will – per day. And don't even think about mixing it with other cyber-stimulants; follow the daily dosage guidelines for all CELSIUS products to avoid system overload.

The FDA's cyber-eyes scanned the market and gave the green light for up to 400 mg of caffeine – roughly equivalent to two cans of this futuristic fuel. But don't get too cocky, citizen; everyone metabolizes this synthetic buzz differently. It's like trying to hack a mainframe – some systems are more vulnerable than others.

Newbies to the energy drink scene? Take it slow, friend. Limit yourself to one CELSIUS product in a 24-hour cycle. High tolerance, you say? Okay, but don't overdo it; cap your daily intake at two CELSIUS beverages or one Celsius Essentials cocktail every 24 hours.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a date with a cyber-angel and a bottle of CELSIUS..."
an author of a 19th-century Gothic Novel,"As the moon casts its silvery glow upon the darkness that lies within, heed this warning, dear consumer, for thy mortal form is not equipped to withstand the potent elixir that lies within these cans. Two 12 oz vessels, nay, no more than two servings, shall be thine daily allotment, lest thou invite the wrath of the caffeine gods upon thy troubled soul.

But soft, good reader, the FDA hath spoken, and its voice is as a gentle breeze on a summer's day. It saith that up to 400 mg of this mystic potion - an amount equal to two 12 oz flasks of CELSIUS Energy Drink - shall be thy daily ration, and it shall not harm thee... at least, not for most individuals. Alas, the curse of caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person, like the capricious whims of a mischievous sprite.

And thou, dear novice, who art new to these enchanted drinks, take heed! For one CELSIUS product in a 24-hour period shall be thy limit, lest thou fall prey to the darkness that lurks within. And thou, oh caffeine connoisseur, with thy tolerance as hard as steel and unyielding as the stone walls of a forgotten castle, heed this warning: no more than two CELSIUS beverages, or one Celsius Essentials elixir every 24 hours shall be thine portion. Lest thou invite the fiendish whispers of the caffeine demon to torment thee in thy sleep."
