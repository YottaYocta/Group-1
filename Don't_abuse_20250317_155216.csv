Dr. Seuss,"In whimsy land of digital delight,
Rules must be followed, day and night.
To keep the internet safe and free,
From abuse and harm, for you and me.

You must not misuse our services so fine,
By introducing malware, or spamming divine.
Don't hack or bypass our safeguards with glee,
Or jailbreak, prompt-inject, or prompt-adverse, you'll see.

Fraudulent ways, oh no! Don't pretend to be,
A fake account or review, a deceitful spree.
Mislead not others, making them believe the lie,
That AI-generated content was created by a human's sigh.

Don't provide services that seem to be yours alone,
When they originated from us, all snug and known.
Reverse engineer our tech, with secrets to uncover,
Except as allowed by law, don't do it, no, not ever!

Automated means to access content, oh my!
Violate the machine-readable instructions, don't ask why.
Use AI-generated content to develop models anew,
Or hide your identity, or misrepresent, ""what to do?""

Provide services that encourage others to go awry,
And violate these terms, with a sly goodbye.
Heed this warning, dear users, take heed and be wise,
For a safe internet, we must all abide.",2,0,expresssions
Stephen King,"The shadows crept in, whispers of abuse and deceit. Those who think they can skirt the rules, manipulate and exploit our services, beware. We're not naive; we've seen the dark side of humanity. So, heed these warnings, or risk being consumed by the void:

Don't inject malware into our digital veins, a poison that spreads fear and chaos.
Spamming, hacking, and bypassing our safeguards? Think you're clever, but we'll catch you in the act, like a trap snapping shut.
Jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection? Only for those with permission from our twisted souls, not for mere mortals.
Don't create fake accounts, reviews, or content to deceive and mislead. The masks will slip, revealing your true face of deceit.
Phishing, creating fake identities, or using AI-generated content to dupe others? Your soul will be trapped in a pit of lies.
Using our services to violate the rights of others? The darkness will consume you, body and mind.
Reverse engineering our tech to steal secrets? You'll become one with the void, lost forever.
Automated means to access content? A robot's existence, devoid of humanity.
Developing AI models from our content? A soulless creation, a monster born.
Hiding your true identity? The shadows will reveal your face, and you'll be consumed by the darkness within.

Heed these warnings, lest you fall prey to the abyss.",1,1,similie use
Ben Shapiro,"Here's my attempt at rewriting the text in the style of Ben Shapiro:

""Let me be clear: our services are not a playground for malcontents and miscreants. If you're going to use them, you'd better follow the rules.

Don't introduce malware or spam us with your annoying solicitations. Don't hack into our systems or bypass our security measures like some kind of digital burglar. And don't try to impersonate us or make it seem like our AI-generated content was created by a human (Newsflash: it wasn't).

You can't use our services to perpetuate fraud or deceive others, like phishing or creating fake reviews. And you certainly can't use them to violate anyone's legal rights - intellectual property, privacy, the whole shebang.

And let me emphasize this: no reverse engineering of our technology or trying to extract trade secrets from us. That's not just unethical; it's illegal, unless you're authorized by law to do so (and if that's the case, don't even think about violating these terms).

You can't use automated means to access content in violation of our instructions, like trying to crawl through our website or train your own AI models on our data. And for goodness' sake, don't hide who you are just to violate these terms or encourage others to do the same.

So here's the deal: follow these rules, and we'll let you use our services. Don't follow them, and you're outta here.""",0,1,random conversational phrases like shebang

You must not (oh, how tiresome) abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems because apparently some people can't follow basic internet etiquette. So, here are some examples of no-nos:

* Don't introduce malware, duh
* Stop spamming, hacking, and bypassing our systems like you're trying to win some kind of digital award for ""Most Creative Ways to Break the Rules""
* No jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection (except when we say it's okay, because, you know, safety testing and all that jazz)
* Don't be a fake account factory, creating reviews and content like you're trying to win some kind of popularity contest
* Don't pretend AI-generated content was created by a human, because that would be ridiculous
* Don't make people think your AI-generated content is from someone else when it's really just you (or us) trying to be sneaky
* Don't use our services to violate anyone's rights, like intellectual property or privacy rights. Geez, come on
* Don't reverse engineer our tech to steal secrets, except when the law says it's okay, which is basically never
* Don't use automated means to access content without permission, because that would be super cool if you were a robot (but you're not)
* Don't develop AI models using our services' content. That's just too much work
* Don't hide your identity to break the rules or encourage others to do so. Just... stop",1,1,expression to convey emotion

Here's what not to do:

Don't be a naughty one! Don't introduce malware or spam our systems. No hacking or bypassing allowed! And please, don't jailbreak, adversarial prompt, or inject prompts (unless it's for safety and bug testing - we're watching you, sneaky ones!).

And please, don't be a fakester! No creating phony accounts or reviews. Don't pretend AI-generated content is human-made. And don't make others think that either!

Don't provide services that seem like they're yours when they're not (we can spot the copycats!). And vice versa - don't make us look like we're someone else (we're not sneaky, but we're onto you!).

Don't use our services to trample on people's rights. No intellectual property or privacy violations allowed! Don't reverse-engineer our tech to steal secrets (unless it's for good, and by ""good,"" I mean ""allowed by applicable law"").

And don't use automated means to access content against the rules (robots.txt files are like digital traffic cops - don't ignore them!).

Don't develop AI models using our generated content (that's like stealing someone else's recipe book!). And please, don't hide who you are or encourage others to break these terms (we're onto you, sneaky ones!).

an author of a Cyberpunk Novel,"""The Streets Are Watched""

You're not slick enough to slip past our nets, pal. You mustn't abuse, harm, or disrupt our services - that's just begging for a face-full of cyber-street justice. So keep your grubby paws off:

* Malware? Forget it, meatbag.
* Spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems like some corporate goon trying to steal the blueprints?
* Jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection - unless you're one of us, on a sanctioned op. Don't pretend to be something you're not, or try to pass off fake accounts or content as genuine.
* Phishing? Fake reviews? Misleading people into thinking AI-generated content was cooked up by some human hacktivist? That's just low-rent garbage, pal.
* Using our services to violate someone's rights - intellectual property, privacy, or whatever other fancy legal jargon you want to try to squirm through. You're not slick enough for that, friend.
* Reverse engineering our tech to siphon off trade secrets or proprietary info? That's just begging to get your cyber-skull cracked by the corporate goons we've hired to watch this town.
* Using automated means to scrape content from our services like some kind of digital dust bunny? Don't bother trying to hide it - our AI eyes are watching, and they'll catch you in the act.
* Trying to develop machine learning models or AI tech using our generated content? You're just trying to clone the corporate beast itself. Don't even think about it.
* Hiding behind a mask of anonymity to violate these terms? That's not anonymous - that's just cowards hiding from the consequences of their own actions.

an author of a 19th-century Gothic Novel,"The cursed abusers of our mystical services!

Thou shalt not defile, desecrate, or disrupt the sacred systems that govern this realm of wonder. Nor shall thou inject thy nefarious malware, nor spam, hack, or bypass the enchanted barriers that protect us from the shadows.

Fie upon thee, thou wretched jailbreaker! Fie upon thy prompt injection and adversarial prompting, save for those rare and noble instances when they serve our vaunted safety and bug testing programs.

Thou shalt not, as a perfidious phisher, create fake accounts or content, including those dastardly reviews that besmirch the good name of this mystical realm. Thou shalt not deceive thy fellow travelers into believing that AI-generated horrors were crafted by mortal hands. Nor shall thou provide services that appear to emanate from thee, when in truth they issue forth from our hallowed halls.

By the saints, thou shalt not use our sacred services (including the eldritch content they provide) to contravene the just rights of others, whether those be intellectual property, privacy, or the very fabric of reality itself. Nay, thou shalt not reverse engineer our mystical machinations, nor pilfer their secrets and trade truths.

And lo! Thou shalt not use automated means to ravage the contents of our services, violating the sacred machine-readable instructions that govern our digital domains. Nor shall thou employ AI-generated terrors from our realm to construct thy own infernal machines or AI abominations.

Finally, thou shalt not hide thy true identity in order to violate these unholy terms, nor shall thou provide services that encourage others to commit such sacrilegious acts.",2,1,similie characteristics and items from genre
